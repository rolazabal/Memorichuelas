# Memorichuelas

`Memorichuelas` is an interactive vocabulary-learning app for Puerto Rican spanish. 

## Inspiration and Purpose

The name, a combination of the words memoria (memory) and habichuelas (beans), is a reference to [`Membean`][mem], the online English vocabulary learning service that inspired my project.
[`Membean`][mem] offers its users a personalized and gamified way of acquiring new vocabulary words through interactive quizzes.<br>
My vision was to use this concept and apply it to the preservation and dissemination of Puerto Rican culture; 
To paraphrase from my initial proposal: Puerto Ricans have historically been displaced from the island at the hands of U.S. colonialism and many have severed connections to the islandâ€™s culture and practices. 
Our national dialect of Spanish is one such practice and very few online resources exist to address this.<br>
`Memorichuelas` is designed for people with some existing knowledge of the Spanish language, enough to read or infer via context clues, as there are available resources online for learning general Spanish.
