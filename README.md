Memorichuelas is an interactive vocabulary-learning app for Puerto Rican spanish. 
The name, a combination of the words memoria (memory) and habichuelas (beans), is a reference to Membean, the online English vocabulary learning service that inspired my project. 
Membean offers its users a personalized and gamified way of acquiring new vocabulary words through interactive quizzes. 
My vision was to use this concept and apply it to the preservation and dissemination of Puerto Rican culture; 
To paraphrase from my initial proposal: “Puerto Ricans have historically been displaced from the island at the hands of U.S. colonialism and many have severed connections to the island’s culture and practices. 
Our national dialect of Spanish is one such practice and very few online resources exist to address this.” 
Memorichuelas is designed for people with some existing knowledge of the Spanish language, enough to read or infer via context clues, but this is fine as there are plenty of resources online for general Spanish.
